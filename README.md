# UNITE Coach Map

Hello! This repository contains a UNITE coaching map using GIMP as the "GUI". 

Please follow the instructions below to make use of it. 

# Instructions

1. Download the .xcf file by clicking **"UNITE Coach Map.xcf"** from the directory above.
2. Download and Install the latest version of **[GIMP](https://www.gimp.org)** if you don't already have it installed.
3. [**Optional**] For ease of drawing on the map, I suggest using a software that allows you to draw over your screen. I personally recommend **[Epic Pen](https://epicpen.com)**, it is mostly free-to-use with some advanced features locked behind a paywall.
