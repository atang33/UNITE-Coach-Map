# UNITE Coach Map

Hello! This repository contains a UNITE coaching map using GIMP as the "GUI". 

Please follow the instructions below to make use of it. 

## Instructions

1. Download the .xcf file by clicking **"UNITE Coach Map.xcf"** from the directory above.
2. Download and Install the latest version of **[GIMP](https://www.gimp.org)** if it is not already installed.
3. **[Optional]** For ease of drawing on the map, using a software that allows you to draw over your screen is recommended. Our recommendation is **[Epic Pen](https://epicpen.com)**, it is mostly free-to-use with some advanced features locked behind a paywall.  

## Usage
1. The only "Dockable Dialogue" needed is "Layers", it can be accessed via "Ctrl+L" or "Windows"->"Dockable Dialogue"->"Layers". It is enabled by default. 
2. The "Layers" container for the project looks like this:

 3. The user can click the "eye" icons to hide the various layers (sprites) /layer groups.
 4. Only the Main Pokemons (the ones that can be controlled in game) can be dragged around by default. All other elements are locked in place by default.
 5. When finished, we recommend not saving the file, so the sprites will be in their default position when the file is opened again.
